  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p class="about-subtitle">
    Software engineer focused on building practical systems with real-world impact.
  </p>

  <hr class="about-divider">

  <h2>Who I Am</h2>

  <p>
    I approach software as a systems problem. My focus is on backend engineering
    and application architecture, with a strong interest in performance,
    optimization, and how software behaves under real hardware constraints.
    I care about writing structured, maintainable code while understanding how
    memory, compute, and infrastructure choices impact scalability and efficiency.
  </p>

  <p>
    At this stage, I’m focused on deepening my understanding of backend systems,
    refining how I structure applications, and pushing my projects beyond
    “it works” into “it’s engineered well.” I believe progress comes from
    consistent iteration — building, evaluating, and improving with each version.
  </p>

  <h2>What Motivates Me</h2>

  <ul class="motivation-list">
    <li>Building software that connects cleanly across systems</li>
    <li>Understanding performance, optimization, and constraints</li>
    <li>Designing tools that could scale into real infrastructure</li>
    <li>Creating reliable foundations instead of temporary fixes</li>
    <li>Growing through disciplined, consistent improvement</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Current Focus</h2>

  <p>
    I’m currently focused on strengthening my backend engineering fundamentals,
    refining my system design skills, and continuing to ship production-ready
    portfolio projects.
  </p>

  <h2>Long-Term Direction</h2>

  <p>
    Long term, I aim to work in software engineering roles that intersect with
    energy systems, infrastructure, and high-impact technical challenges.
    I am particularly interested in building tools that contribute to resilient
    and efficient systems.
